    <p>
        Hydroponic farming is an innovative agricultural method that grows plants without soil. Instead, plants are cultivated 
        in a nutrient-rich water solution, allowing for faster growth, higher yields, and reduced environmental impact.

    <h2>How Hydroponic Farming Works</h2>
    <p>
        In hydroponics, plants receive essential nutrients directly from water. This system eliminates soil-related diseases and 
        provides a controlled environment for optimal plant growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Hydroponic Systems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Deep Water Culture (DWC):</b> Plants are suspended in nutrient-rich water with oxygen supply.</li>
        <li><b>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT):</b> A thin film of water circulates around plant roots for constant feeding.</li>
        <li><b>Drip System:</b> Nutrients are delivered directly to plant roots via a drip irrigation system.</li>
        <li><b>Ebb and Flow (Flood & Drain):</b> Water is periodically flooded into plant beds and then drained.</li>
        <li><b>Aeroponics:</b> Plants are grown in air, with roots misted with nutrient-rich water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of Hydroponic Farming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Higher Yields:</b> Faster plant growth leads to increased food production.</li>
        <li><b>Water Efficiency:</b> Uses up to 90% less water than traditional soil farming.</li>
        <li><b>No Soil Required:</b> Can be implemented in urban spaces, deserts, and even on rooftops.</li>
        <li><b>Fewer Pesticides:</b> Reduces the need for chemical pesticides as soil-borne pests are eliminated.</li>
        <li><b>Space-Saving:</b> Vertical hydroponic farms maximize land usage in cities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges in Hydroponic Farming</h2>
    <p>
        Despite its benefits, hydroponic farming has some challenges, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>High Initial Costs:</b> Setting up a hydroponic system requires investment in infrastructure and technology.</li>
        <li><b>Technical Knowledge:</b> Farmers need to understand water chemistry, nutrient balancing, and pH levels.</li>
        <li><b>Power Dependence:</b> Requires electricity for water circulation and temperature control.</li>
        <li><b>Risk of System Failures:</b> A pump or power failure can quickly impact plant health.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future of Hydroponic Farming</h2>
    <p>
        The future of hydroponic farming looks promising, especially in urban areas where space and water are limited. With advancements 
        in automation, AI-driven nutrient monitoring, and solar-powered hydroponic systems, this technology is set to play a key role in 
        sustainable agriculture.
